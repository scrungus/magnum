    When creating a multi-master cluster, all master nodes will attempt to
    create kubernetes resources in the cluster at this same time, like
    coredns, the dashboard, calico etc. This race conditon shouldn't be
    a problem when doing declarative calls instead of imperative (kubectl
    apply instead of create). However, due to [1], kubectl fails to apply
    the changes and the deployemnt scripts fail causing cluster to creation
    to fail in the case of Heat SoftwareDeployments. This patch passes the
    ResourceGroup index of every master so that resource creation will be
    attempted only from the first master node.
